# AutomateGymBooking

It's the pandemic, gym classes have just re-started and due to social distancing the class capacity at my tinny gym is VERY limited. What does this mean? It means that the gym class booking race has just got FAST (like really FAST) and I don't want to stay up until 00:00 staring at my phone like a socially-depraved mad women waiting for a booking to open.

Like a damsel in distress I needed something to save me, I needed Automation. So, I wrote this sneaky selenium code that books my gym slot at the moment the clock strikes 00:00 (yes Cinderella you can go to the -ball- gym) , praise the Lord for automation (and pray that it doesn't take my job)!

Feel free to give my code a look and let me know if it has encouraged you to automate something. Also, a special thank you @Dragomir for inspiring me with your project:â€¦..
